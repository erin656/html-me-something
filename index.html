    <h1> My Path to LaunchCode </h1>

    
<article>
<h3> How I Got Here </h3>
<p> I went to college at Missouri State and graduated in December 2008 with a degree in Political Science. It was a bad time to be a job seeker, and I worked a couple
    menial jobs as a banquet hall busser and an office/bank janitor before joining the military in December 2009. After leaving the military, I used the GI Bill
    to attend graduate school in urban planning, and made the decision to return directly to STL upon graduation instead of gaining work experience in NYC.
</p>
<p> As I waited for employment in my field, my husband came across LaunchCode and suggested we apply. He is more naturally talented and more focused when
    it comes to our coding homework, whereas I have trouble letting go off some distracted notion that I will suddenly have a job and not need coding.
    This lingering misgiving and my irritation at my husband's superior skill and dedication make me a somewhat half-hearted student, but I do enjoy the
        class and am excited to see more real world applications of coding. </p>

<h3> What I'm Doing Now </h3>
<p> Since moving back to STL with my husband, I have spent most of my time looking for a house and a job, in that order. The house hunting took far longer
    than we had hoped and, after losing two houses we had under contract and getting our hopes up over a half dozen more, we finally became homeowners on
    December 23, 2016. Since then we have been painting, repairing, and moving into our new home. The job hunt has been less productive however. </p>

    <p> As a recent graduate, I have been looking for entry level jobs in urban and regional planning. I want to work for the City of St. Louis or the East-West
        Gateway Council of Governments, but entry level planning jobs at those organizations are few and far between. I apply for those I see and try to trust
        that I will eventually find a job in my field.

    <h3> Where (I Hope) I'm Going </h3>
    <p>        Even if I were to suddenly be offered a job, it would be important to continue the course, because I am heavily trained in GIS and use databases in analysis and records management as an urban planner;
        already, I have learned Python skills that are applicable to my chosen field. I have also always wanted to be able to make webpages as so many non-profit
        and community groups have terrible websites that fail to convey information effectively and are rarely updated. Whether I get a job soon or not, I want
        to complete the course and apply my new skills to planning problems and to building a portfolio to use in future job applications. I also want to help
        my local neighborhood association by imrpoving their web presence and data management. </p>
